# 21-days-of-Euler
A self-derived, self-inflicted coding challenge/journey in which participants will endeavour to complete 10 [project euler](https://projecteuler.net/show=all) problems in 21 days.

## The Rules:
1. You can solve problems you have already solved *in a different language.*
2. Submissions/commits are to be made on regular 2-day intervals. 1 problem per submission.
3. All problem/language combinations must be submitted on day 1.
4. You can research solutions to the problem but avoid solutions posted in the same language
5. You can re-use method/function definitions or libraries previously written


## My list:

| Day | Date | Problem | Language |
| --- | ---- | ------- | -------- |
| 3   | 11-2-2015 | 1 | Ruby |
| 5   | 13-2-2015 | 2 | Ruby |
| 7 | 15-2-2015 | 1 | C(/C++) |
| 9 | 17-2-2015 | 2 | C(/C++) |
| 11 | 19-2-2015 | 6 | C(/C++) |
| 13 | 21-2-2015 | 1 | Bash/awk or similar) |
| 15 | 23-2-2015 | 18 | C(/C++) |
| 17 | 25-2-2015 | 67 | C(/C++) |
| 19 | 23-2-2015 | 18 | Ruby |
| 21 | 25-2-2015 | 67 | Ruby |
